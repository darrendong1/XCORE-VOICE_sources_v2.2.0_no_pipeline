Introduction
============

``lib_mic_array`` is a library for interfacing with one or more PDM microphones
on an XMOS device. 

Version 5.0 of this library has been redesigned from scratch to make efficient
usage of the XMOS XS3 architecture.

See :ref:`getting_started` to get going.

.. note::

  Version 5.0 does not currently support XS2 or XS1 devices. Please use version 4.5.0 if you need support for these devices: https://github.com/xmos/lib_mic_array/releases/tag/v4.5.0
